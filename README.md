# Trapezoidal Map - Computational geometry project

This project was done in the course `LMECA2170 Numerical Geometry`. It is an implementation of the trapezoidal map algorithm presented by Mark de Berg et al. in the book _Computational Geometry: Algorithms and Applications_.

The program is interactive so that one can add segments and see the modification of the map in real-time. It is also possible, among others, to load files with pre-existing segments, and to create particles that bounce on the segments.

## Installation and execution
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./bin/myTpz
```

> Once the code is executed, the list of commands is available by pressing `H` in the GUI.
